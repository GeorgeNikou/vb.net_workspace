## Video Store Project
A team project consisting of three members where I was chosen as leader. The video store application acts as an old blockbuster-esk style terminal where employees can issue rentals and have access to every movie within their stores database

Actions include:
* Create users/movie/employee
* read user/movie/employee
* update user/movie/employee
* delete user/movie/employee
* rent movie

## database
* MySQL

## Intergrated Development Interface
* Visual Studios
